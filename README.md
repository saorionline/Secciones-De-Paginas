# Faker API breakdown of its functionality and some potential improvements

The code defines a route ```(/products)``` that responds with an array of 100 fake product objects.
Each product object includes:
```name```: Generated using ```faker.commerce.productName()``` for descriptive product names.
```price```: Generated using ```faker.commerce.price()```, then converted to an integer with ```parseInt(faker.commerce.price(),10)```.
```image```: Generated using ```faker.image.imageUrl()```, providing a random image URL.

# Potential Improvements:

# Performance
Generating 100 products at once might be resource-intensive, especially if you expect a high volume of requests. Consider:

# Pagination
Implement pagination to return products in smaller chunks (e.g., 10 or 20 per page) based on query parameters. This reduces the data sent in a single response and improves performance.
Lazy loading: If you only display a limited number of products on the frontend at a time, consider lazy loading additional products as the user scrolls or paginates. This avoids sending unnecessary data upfront.
Customization: You might want to control the range of product prices or the types of images generated. Faker provides various methods for customization:

```faker.commerce.price(min, max)```: Specify a minimum and maximum price range.
```faker.image.imageUrl(width, height)```: Define desired image dimensions.

# Error Handling: 

While ```faker.commerce.price()``` usually returns a valid number, it's good practice to handle potential errors during parsing:
```javascript
price: Number.isNaN(parseInt(faker.commerce.price(), 10)) ? 0 : parseInt(faker.commerce.price(), 10),
```
