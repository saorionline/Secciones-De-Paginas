## Typescript Setup

Rulebook, tell the TypeScript compiler how to handle code

## Next Setup

Regardless of whether you're using TypeScript or not. Acts as a central hub for customizing various aspects of Next.js application. Defines configuration of routing, build options, environment variables and webpack. Modular and Clean

## Tailwind Setup

After creating the project, install peer dependencies and the paths of my templating files. 

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
 
    // Or if using `src` directory:
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
> Add the Tailwind directives to my CSS

```javascript
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
Start my build process
```javascript
npm run dev
```
Start using Tailwind in my project

# MobileMenu

### Imports

* ```import { useState } from 'react'```: This imports the ```useState``` hook from React, which is used to manage the state of the mobile menu (whether it's open or closed).
* ```import { Dialog, DialogPanel } from '@headlessui/react'```: This imports the ```Dialog``` and ```DialogPanel``` components from @headlessui/react. These components provide a structure for creating modal dialogs, which is what your mobile menu seems to be.
* ```import { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'```: This imports the ```Bars3Icon``` and ```XMarkIcon``` components from ```@heroicons/react/24/outline```. These icons represent the hamburger menu for opening the mobile menu and the "X" icon for closing it, respectively.

### Navigation Data

```const navigation = [...]```: This defines a constant named ```navigation``` that holds an array of objects. Each object represents an item in the navigation menu, with properties like ```name``` and ```href``` (though currently the ```href``` values are set to #).

### ```Example```Component

```export default function Example() { ... }```: This defines the default export of the file, which is a functional React component named ```Example```.

### State Management

const ```[mobileMenuOpen, setMobileMenuOpen] = useState(false)```: This line uses the ```useState``` hook to create a state variable named ```mobileMenuOpen``` with an initial value of ```false``` (indicating the menu is closed). It also defines a setter function ```setMobileMenuOpen``` to update the state.

### JSX (Missing Parts)

The provided code snippet ends with ```(<div>//Rest of code</div>)```. While we can't see the complete JSX here, it likely involves:

Conditional rendering of the mobile menu content based on the ```mobileMenuOpen``` state.
Use of the ```Dialog``` and ```DialogPanel``` components to create the modal dialog for the menu.
Rendering of the navigation links and icons using components from ```@headlessui/react``` and ```@heroicons/react/24/outline```.

### Overall

This code sets up the basic structure for your mobile menu component in Next.js. It manages the state of the menu, defines the navigation data, and uses libraries like @headlessui/react and @heroicons/react/24/outline for the UI structure and icons. You'll need to fill in the rest of the JSX to complete the functionality and rendering of the mobile menu content.
